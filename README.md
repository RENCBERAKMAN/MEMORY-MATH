# 🎮 MemoryMath — Stretch Your Memory With Code

**MemoryMath** is a two-player card-matching game created in **Unreal Engine 5**, powered by **C++** and enhanced with visuals made in **Blender**.

Players take turns flipping cards on a grid to find and match **+ID** and **-ID** pairs. Matching pairs vanish, and points are awarded. A wrong match ends the player's turn.

🃏 The game logic is smooth:  
✔️ Cards flip with animations  
✔️ Matches are detected and removed  
✔️ The score updates live on the UI  
✔️ Turn-based control swaps between players

## 🧠 What I Learned

This was more than just a game — it was a dive into real-world development. Here's what I gained:

- ✅ How to connect gameplay and visuals using C++ and Blueprints together  
- ✅ Creating custom UMG widgets and updating them from C++  
- ✅ Using the **delegate system** to communicate between actors  
- ✅ Understanding how to place and randomize scene actors in code  
- ✅ Fixing compiler and linker errors confidently  
- ✅ Structuring cleaner, readable, and reusable code

## 🛠 Blender & UI

I created a simple, clean card model in **Blender** to ensure visual consistency.  
On the interface side, I learned to keep the **UI minimal and functional**, building it directly within **UMG**.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- 🎮 **Unreal Engine 5**  
- 🔤 **C++**  
- 📐 **Blender**  
- 🎨 **UMG** (UI Design)

## 🔚 Final Thoughts

MemoryMath was a small project with big lessons. It helped me understand how gameplay mechanics, UI systems, and code structure come together to form an interactive experience.
